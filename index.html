  <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Global Terrorism Analysis</h2>
    <p>A full stack interactive dashboard analyzing the grow and spread of terrorism from 2000-2016, using machine learning
      models to predict trends and rising terrorism world wide.</p>
    <p>Role: Front End Web Development and Data Analyst: </br>
       Reverse engineered a website template to fit the need and scope of our project, cutomized navbar to function with javascript scroll
       triggers and various buttons. Analyzed our data to look for trends, and did additional research to put a story to what our data was
       showing, such as diving into specific years and finding notable events leading to higher casualties or attacks in that year. Spent
       a little time learning Django backend development, but due to a short time frame had to focus most of my efforts on the front 
       end product.</p>

    <h2>Craft Beer Analysis, ETL Project</h2>
    <p>An analysis of craft beers around the United States, where they're brewed, whats being brewed the most, and using supply
       and demand logic to determine whats popular amongst consumers. Useful in marketing.</p>
    <p>Role: Front End Web Development and Data Analyst: </br>
    Built our website from scratch, including drop down navbar. Aside from front end development, spend a considerable amount of time
    doing ETL work for this project on a dataset from Kaggle. Using PANDAS and Python to manipulate a very large dataset to filter the information
    we needed, we could then use Matplotlib to graph and present our findings. Data cleaning was a very important skill learned on this project.
